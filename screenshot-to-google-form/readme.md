## In the program, replace only **url** and **no** value where, url is the URL of attacker google form and no is the value for google form input that is, for example this is the source of our google form,

```
<input type="text" name="entry.2021846" value="" 
class="ss-q-short required" id="entry_2021846" dir="auto" 
aria-label="First and Last Name Please enter your full name
" aria-required="true" required="" title="">

the no is '2021846' as name="entry.2021846" in the above example.
