On running screenshot.py, a screenshot of the system is taken and sent to google form in the form of base64 encoded string.
## In the program, replace only **url** and **no** value where, for example this is the source of our google form,

```
<input type="text" name="entry.2021846" value="" 
class="ss-q-short required" id="entry_2021846" 
dir="auto" aria-label="First and Last Name Please enter your full name" 
aria-required="true" required="" title="">
```
the no is '2021846' as name="entry.2021846" in the above example and url is URL of the google form.
